# GenericCollections
In a new project, instantiate an instance of each of the generic collection classes described in Chapter 18:  List&lt;T>, LinkedList&lt;T>, Queue&lt;T>, Stack&lt;T>, Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue>, SortedList&lt;TKey, TValue>, and HashSet&lt;T>). Insert 5 values of a type of your choosing into each of these collections, then iterate over the collection and print each value to the console. Print a line above your iteration stating which data structure you're printing from, and print a blank line between the last item in the collection and the description of the following data structure.
